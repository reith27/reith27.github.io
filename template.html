      <h3>Ritharshan Makenthiran</h3>
      <p> I have been doing Computer science since secondary school. I took an interest
          into it because my older brother was majoring in Computing. I saw him program
          and thought it looked fun so I picked it up. I've had experience with mainly
	  python and visual basic. I've created a Snake game in Visual basic for my college
	  coursework where I got an A*.</p>

    <h3>Stickrunner</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project in City is Stickrunner.  It is a game where you have
	to reach the portal with at least one life remaining. You have to try and avoid 
	the dragons as the green dragons remove one life and the red dragons remove two lives.
	You can use as many crates as you'd like to make the run easier. Both lives left
	and crates used can be seen on the top left.    </p>
